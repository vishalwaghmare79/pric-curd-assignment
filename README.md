## **Assignment Solution**

#### **User Dashboard Application (CRUD operations)**

The app allows you to perform the following CRUD operations:
1. **Create:** Add a new user with `name` and `email`.
2. **Read:** Fetch and display users from the Firebase Realtime Database.
3. **Update:** Edit an existing userâ€™s details.
4. **Delete:** Remove a user from the system.

#### **Docker Containerization:**

- **Dockerfile:** 
    - A Dockerfile is included to containerize the application.
    - The Docker container runs the app on port 3000.
    - Dockerfile contains the build steps to ensure that the production build is optimized and the application can be deployed.

**Dockerfile Example:**
```dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js image from Docker Hub
FROM node:latest

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only package.json and package-lock.json (if available)
COPY package*.json ./

# Install node modules
RUN npm install --silent

# Copy the rest of the application files to the working directory
COPY . .

# Build the Next.js app for production
RUN npm run build

# Expose the port that the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the Next.js app in production mode
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```
